      <p>

        Hi! I'm Khurram Ghullamani. I graduated in May 2017 with a degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at
        Urbana-Champaign. My interests lie in full-stack web and mobile application development.

        <br />
        <br /> I am currently a Software Engineer at Oranj, a Chicago based startup that is designing software for financial advisors
        looking to help clients effectively manage their financial lives and personal goals. Outside of work, I enjoy biking on Chicago's trails, hikiing, table tennis and reading. 
        My favorite books include Gone Girl, The Fault in our Stars and The Kite Runner.

        <br />
        <br /> I am extremely passionate about the intersection between Computer Science and education. In fact, I majored in Computer
        Science after my experience teaching a computer seminar to senior citizens and observing the power of technology
        to empower individuals. In 2016, my roommate and I launched
        <a href="https://icodecamp.github.io" target="_blank">Code Camp</a>, a seven week bootcamp aimed at teaching college students and young 
        professionals programming fundamentals through web programming. In 2017, we had our second iteration of Code Camp, using Python. 
        We just wrapped up our third iteration of Code Camp, leveraging Javascript and Khan Academy's Computer Programming playlist. We also
        completed a one day HTML/CSS seminar for young professionals.

        <br />
        <br /> I've said all I wanted to say! Feel free to check out my resume as well as my projects on GitHub and connect with
        me on social networking sites. I am always open to new projects and opportunities!

        <br />
        <br /> Enjoy!

        <br />
        <br />
